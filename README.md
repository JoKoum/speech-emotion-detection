## Speech Emotion Recognition
---
#### Semester project for the Multimodal Machine Learning class of the [MSc in Artificial Intelligence](http://msc-ai.iit.demokritos.gr/) by NCSR Demokritos and University of Piraeus

The project evaluates the performance of traditional Machine Learning techniques and Deep Learning methods over predicting the correct emotion of the given human speech audio example.

The [SAVEE](http://kahlan.eps.surrey.ac.uk/savee/Download.html) and the [TESS](https://www.kaggle.com/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess) datasets were selected for the emotion recognition task.

[pyAudioAnalysis](https://github.com/tyiannak/pyAudioAnalysis) and [Deep Audio Features](https://github.com/tyiannak/deep_audio_features) libraries were used for the experiments that took place.

##### You can clone the project from repository using the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/JoKoum/speech-emotion-detection.git

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb) environment was used for the project development.
